This is general purpose monitoring agent for Java application servers.

Basic features (current and planned):
- integration with commonly used monitoring systems: Zabbix, Nagios (planned);
- programmability - zorka can be extended using BSH scripts;
- mapped mbeans - user can map calcluated values from some mbeans into other
  mbeans (on attribute basis); standard JMX clients can fetch these values;
- rank lists - customizable thread ranks, mbean ranks etc.
- (more to come);


Note that this is development snapshot of Zorka agent. It is currently unstable,
undocumented and its APIs will change over time.
